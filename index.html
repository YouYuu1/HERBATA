<p> Tea outside of China </p>
<p> It wasn't until around 803 AD that the monk Dengyō Daishi brought the first seeds of the tea plant from China to Japan, where it began to be cultivated. Tea-drinking culture took quite different forms in the two countries. The differences are mainly due to a different philosophical approach. In Japan, the tea ceremony related to the ascetic philosophy and aestborn, and is cultivated in this country to this day. It is an art characterized by a love of beauty. Kakuzō Okakura (Tenshin), author of the monograph The Book of Tea (Cha no hon, 1906), describes this ceremony as a cult based on the adoration of the beauty that exists in the midst of the mundane realities of everyday existence. </p>
<p></p>hetics of Zen Buddhism, called cha-no-yu (literally "boiling water for tea") was 
The Chinese rites , on the other hand, much older than the Japanese ones, related to Taoism and Confucianism as well as the beliefs and practices of various peoples inhabiting mainland China, have undergone strong regionalization over the centuries. Today, throughout China, you can encounter numerous tea drinking ceremonies that are characteristic of, for example, various national minorities. Tea in China is held in such high esteem that it is even a key element of traditional Chinese weddings. </p>
<p></p>
Tea appeared in Mongolia at the end of the 5th century AD, and in Tibet in 620 AD, in Tibet it very quickly became the staple drink (along with koumiss), and in Mongolia it became popular in the 12th century . However, unlike China and Japan, there were no such extensive tea drinking ceremonies, and the process of making tea and the taste of the tea differed significantly from the Chinese pattern. </p>
<p></p>
<p> A trip to Europe </p>
<p> For the first time, the Russians encountered tea in the first half of the 16th century, during the conquest of Siberia and diplomatic contacts with China. In Russia, tea is traditionally called chaj (Russian: чай) and is prepared in a samovar, without milk, but in the form of a very strong, intense infusion. </p>
<p></p>
<p> It came to India from China as masala chaj (चाय). In India, chai is also available from street vendors called chajwala. They carry teapots of hot tea and serve it in freshly roasted earthenware cups, thrown away immediately after consumption. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Tea went to Arab countries with Indian merchants. In Arabic, tea is referred to as شاي (šāī, szaj). The first information about tea in Western Europe comes from the end of the 16th century (Marco Polo does not mention it). They were given by the Jesuit JP Maffei (1589) in the work of History of India. After him, Mikołaj Trigault (1615) and Alvaro Samedo (1643) wrote about tea. </p>
<p></p>
After them , a much greater scope of information was provided by the Polish missionary, traveler and naturalist Michał Boym, noting two types of tea: green and yellow (the so-called flower tea), and that the leaves are also dried on fire, not only in the sun. In the manuscript Rerum Sinensium Compendiosa Descriptio, written before 1656, he described tea as follows: </p>
<p></p>
The shrub from the leaves of which the drink, famous throughout China , is prepared is called Cia. They collect leaves on the hills, dry them over low heat on iron nets and pour boiling water over them, which makes it green or yellow. They usually delight in drinking it bitter. By adding sweets to it, they often treat guests to it. The Japanese mix the leaf powder with water and drink it. The unit of weight of the best tea is often very expensive. It refreshes in hot weather, prevents stone formation and prevents sleepiness. </p>

<p> Tea was brought to Europe by the Dutch at the beginning of the 17th century. Tea came to England in 1658 thanks to the merchant Thomas Garraway. In 1618, tea appeared in Russia as a gift from the Emperor of China to Tsar Michael I Romanov. </p>
<p></p>
<p> In the mid-nineteenth century, the British East India Company began large-scale cultivation in India from cuttings and seeds imported from China by Robert Fortune. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Poland </p>
She came to Poland in 1664 from France . The first known references to tea appear in a letter from King Jan II Kazimierz to his wife, Ludwika Maria. Initially, it was treated as a medicinal herb and the custom of drinking tea did not spread until the second half of the 18th century, which was also helped by good trade relations between Poland and England. Due to the high price, this drink was drunk only at the royal court, magnate courts and rich nobility and townspeople. Due to numerous contacts with Russia and the USSR in Poland, especially in the lost eastern territories, and later among the repatriates, the term czaj was often used to describe tea. A device for brewing it, called a samovar, was also popular in these areas. </p>
<p></p>
<p> In prison dialect, the form of chajura is used as a synonym for a very strong infusion of a mixture of tea, coffee and tobacco (e.g. 6 tablespoons of tea, 6 tablespoons of coffee, tobacco from one cigarette) poured over with boiling water boiled with a mouthful. </p>
